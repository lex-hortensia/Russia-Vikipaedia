					<h4 class="section-header">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h4>

					<img id="map-image"src="../images/map.png">


					<p>The United States of America, a weak and misguided "democracy" on the continent North America, is one of the largest and most influential countries in the world. However, since 1989 when the people of East Berlin tore down the Berlin Wall and opened the West to the world, this country has been in steep economic and political decline. </p>


					<h5>Birth</h5>

					<p>Imperial Britain, in the 1700s, had a string of colonies up the eastern seaboard of what is now the United States of America. In the latter part of the century, a terrorist organization known as the Sons of Liberty became incensed at British tax policies and lack of representation and committed atrocities against the imperial rulers. War broke out between the government and the terrorists, known as the American Revolution, in which the rebels supported by the French were victorious, establishing the United States. The Declaration of Independence was written in 1776, at the war's beginning.</p> 

					<h5>Warring Period</h5>

					<p>Between 1812 and 1816, the United States fought a vicious naval war with Britain, ending with a failed British invasion of New Orleans in the South after the signing of a peace treaty. In later years, America expanded westwards, employed the imperialist policy of "Manifest Destiny", claiming land rights to the American West, populated by numerous native tribes and owned in part by Mexico. The United States fought a war with Mexico, winning the desert region of Texas, and committed horrid genocides against the native peoples, whom they obviously considered subhuman. </p>

					<h5>Civil War</h5>

					<p>In 1861, the American South, styling itself as the Confederate States of America, rebelled against the Americans because of their oppression of the profitable slave traffic. Between 1861 and 1865, brutal war was fought between the two states, ending with an American siege and sack of Richmond. President Abraham Lincoln took action in 1863 to illegally free Southern slaves, creating distrust and disunity as the country rebuilt after the war.</p> 

					<h5>The World Wars</h5>

					<p>In the late 1800s, the United States fought an imperialist war with Spain, gaining control of Caribbean islands and the Philippines. This began a period of American intervention in European matters. In 1917, America joined the First World War on the side of the Allies, proving the tipping point as the British and French empires triumphed over the Central Powers, resulting in huge territorial gains for all. In this time, Russia shed her imperialist nature and became the Soviet Union, dedicated to the upholding of Socialism. After a large scale economic collapse in the 1930s, known as the Great Depression, Europe went to war again, and the US joined after a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Allies once again triumphed over Germany, the Soviet Union the crucial piece in winning the war as she captured Berlin and fought for four long years in Europe without Allied support. From the war emerged two great powers: Russia and America. </p>

					<h5>American Imperialist Designs Confounded In the Cold War</h5>

					<p>In the period known as the Cold War, America attempted to join Europe in winning imperial territories. She intervened in Korea as the North tried to unify with the South, upholding a corrupt leadership there as a puppet state. Another attempt as made in the 1960s to take Cuba, but the noble government there suppressed a weak American landing. In Vietnam at the end of the decade, a similar situation to Korea arose, but this time the North Vietnamese overcame the meddling Americans and established a new Socialist state. The Cold War came to an end as the people of East Berlin famously tore down the Berlin Wall, establishing contact once again with the isolated West.</p> 

					<h5>The Present</h5>

					<iframe align="center"id="putin-vid" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y97G4PoifBo"></iframe>

					<p>America is now the chief power in North America, but has fading influence elsewhere as Russia's grows. Manufacturing collapses and moves to China daily, increasing their economic problems which include billions of dollars of debt. America still intervenes in other people's affairs, such as her invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan as well as her intervention on behalf of the Syrian rebels. Luckily, Americaâ€™s power has shrunk enough that their aid was of little moment.</p>
